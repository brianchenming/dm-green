# THIS IS THE EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH. 

# Key idea: 
Data grouping by caching most frequently accessed data blocks in the most
efficient disk (like SSD) to make the current device mapper green.  Workloads
that previously go across multiple disks can now be satisified mostly by the SSD
cache, and therefore the other disks can be spin down for power benefit.
