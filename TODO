[DONE] 1. Deploy linux kernel 3.0 (or above) on gr3.

2. Code review for GreenDM. 
	- basic comments [DONE]
	- kernel control of user program to spin down/up disk
	- metadata flush to be made periodical, similar to what
	  pdflush does
	- merge disks reliability concern into implementation 
	- extend vs. sector tradeoff
    - add special mechanism for disk initialization [DONE]

[DONE] 3. Documentation for software stack. 

4. Trace analysis and preparation (online vs. offline)
	- Only offline study for CSE595 considering the time limit

[REVISE] 5. Review on the cache design and implementation.

6. Evaluation of different workloads (web server, file server,
   database server, email server, etc) with three different approaches
	- Naive sectors mapping without knowledge about workload [CSE595]
	- Design test scenario by "dd" [CSE595]
	- Offline trace analysis based [NOT CSE595]
	- Online trace analysis based  [NOT CSE595]

7. Optimization. [NOT CSE595 <-- Time limit]
	- IO by-passing
	- sequential pre-fetch by trace analysis
	- reliability optimization with reliability aware policy
	- extent overhead optimization
	- explore workloads with different IO patterns 
	- Two levels Cache (RAM)
	- etc. 

8. Paper submission.
	- By May 1, write a report summarizing what has been done so far.
	- Potentially extend the work with more domain knowledge and optimization
	  techniques, submit as one potential paper, and carefully distinguish
	  from massive other approaches.
