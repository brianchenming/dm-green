[DONE] 1. Deploy linux kernel 3.0 (or above) on gr3.
2. Code review for GreenDM. 
	- basic comments [DONE]
	- kernel control of user program to spin down/up disk
	- metadata flush to be made periodical, similar to what
	  pdflush does
	- merge disks reliability concern into implementation 
	- extend vs. sector tradeoff
    - add special mechanism for disk initialization
[DONE] 3. Documentation for software stack. 
4. Trace analysis and preparation (online vs. offline)
[REVISE] 5. Review on the cache design and implementation. 
6. Evaluation of different workloads (web server, file server,
   database server, email server, etc) with three different approaches
	- Naive sectors mapping without knowledge about workload
	- Offline trace analysis based 
	- Online trace analysis based
7. Optimization. 
	- IO by-passing
	- sequential pre-fetch by trace analysis
	- reliability optimization with reliability aware policy
	- extent overhead optimization
	- explore workloads with different IO patterns 
    - finer-grain locks
8. Paper submission. 
	- By May 10, write a report summarizing what has been
	  done so far 
	- Extend the work with more domain knowledge and optimization
	  techniques, and submit as one potential paper.
