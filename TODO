[DONE] 1. Deploy linux kernel 3.0 (or above) on gr3.
2. Code review for GreenDM. 
	- kernel control of user program to spin down/up disk
	- metadata flush to be made periodical, similar to what
	  pdflush does
	- merge disks reliability concern into implementation 
	- extend vs. sector tradeoff
3. Documentation for software stack. 
4. Trace analysis and preparation (online vs. offline)
5. Review on the cache design and implementation. 
6. Evaluation of different workloads (web server, file server,
   database server, email server, etc) with three different approaches
	- Naive sectors mapping without knowledge about workload
	- Offline trace analysis based 
	- Online trace analysis based
7. Optimization. 
	- IO by-passing
	- sequential pre-fetch by trace analysis
	- reliability optimization with reliability aware policy
	- extent overhead optimization
	- explore workloads with different IO patterns 
8. Paper submission. 
	- By May 10, write a paper skeleton summarizing what has been
	  done so far 
	- By September, submit a full length paper to FAST'13
	- More extend work follows what we achieve by then
