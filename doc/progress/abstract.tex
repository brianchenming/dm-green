Storage subsystems in servers are slower than other subsystems despite
the fact that they consume a lot of power. Hybrid disks, which
integrate different characteristics of various kinds of disks in
speed, capacity, price, and power consumption, is a promising solution
to the problem.  Although previous hybrid disk systems have achieved
significant performance boost over traditional magnetic disks, their
energy usage is less studied. In this project, we consider the energy
efficiency as one of the most important features of storage systems.
To better trade-off among power consumption, I/O performance, and
storage capacity, our multi-disk system maps more frequently accessed
blocks (i.e., hot data) to energy-efficient, fast, but small disks
such as SSD to exploit spatial locality of data. Meanwhile, temporal
locality of data is also exploited by grouping blocks that are likely
to be accessed simultaneously.  Instead of scattering blocks among
several disks, we try to map them to a single disk.  The combination
of spatial and temporal locality allows I/O be served using fewer
disks and other disks can spin down to save energy. 

In our experiments for XXX workloads, our system provides a capacity
equal to the sum of all disks (SSD, SAS, and SATA), operates at the
speed near SSD (XX\%), but consumes only XX\% power of a simple linear
hybrid disk consisting of the same disks.

%To identify hot data and block groups, workload-specific traces are
%analyzed offline.  Heuristic algorithm *is* used for adaption to hot
%data and block groups as they evolve over time. We *are* also
%exploring na\"{\i}ve direct I/O map without any knowledge of the
%workloads as baseline approach.
