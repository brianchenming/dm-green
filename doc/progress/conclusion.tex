\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

We have finished the code as discussed in Section \ref{sec:design}.
The target is being tested. We have collected some traces and are
analyzing them to figure out parameters, such as extent size, we
should use. We are going to replay those traces and measure power
consumption to justify our green target does save energy.
