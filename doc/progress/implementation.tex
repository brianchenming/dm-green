\section{Implementation}
\label{implementation}

Length: 0-0.75 pages.


Can be an optional section, if you don't have much to say.

Hard to figure out boundary b/t design and implementation.

Don't put stuff that's suitable for design section.

1. Unexpected implementation/coding issues that came about, and
how you resolved them (hopefully some clever way).  Helps future
researchers avoid the same issues.

2. Effort to develop system: Lines of Code total and per component;
total amount of time spent developing; man-power used.  (Alt: effort
    to run benchmarks and analyze results.)
