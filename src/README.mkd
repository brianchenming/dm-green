# About
An energy-efficient device mapper target that can redirect block reads/writes to
different disks (SATA, SAS, SSD, PCM, SMR) and can potentially power/spin down
disks according to workload block IO characteristics. The aim is balanced
trade-off among power consumption, IO performance and storage capacity by
leveraging strengths of different disks.
