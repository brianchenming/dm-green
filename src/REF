The green target component should be relatively easy and should not
takes too much time: 
	1. Without any workload knowledge, it is just naive mapping. It
works just like "dmsetup create linear-disk  x x linear xxx x x". Code 
can just borrow from dm-stripe.c and linear.c". The only thing the
dm-green needs to do is a Cache replacement algorithm, which can also 
be easily implemented by array counter based LRU algorithm.  
	2. Much more work should be focused on studying workloads and
applications, and build the model with domain knowledge. 
	3. Massive benchmark processes are needed for doing the right 
experiments, preparing the right data, more optimization with results, 
etc.
